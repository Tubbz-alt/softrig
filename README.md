Softrig is a simple software defined radio transceiver application.

Softrig is very much a work in progress...


Objectives:

* Provide a simple and straightforward SDR application for getting the most out
  of commonly available SDR hardware.
* Implement only the most basic SDR functionality but do it well.
* Integrate with external applications through the Hamlib rigctld protocol
  and sedcondary audio interfaces.
* Serve as testbed for experimenting with DSP, SDR and FreeDV.
